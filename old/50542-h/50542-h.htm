<p class='c014'>This little book is intended as a
memorial to the women who came in
<i>The Mayflower</i>, and their comrades who
came later in <i>The Ann</i> and <i>The Fortune</i>,
who maintained the high standards of
home life in early Plymouth Colony.
There is no attempt to make a genealogical
study of any family. The effort is
to reveal glimpses of the communal life
during 1621-1623. This is supplemented
by a few silhouettes of individual matrons
and maidens to whose influence we
may trace increased resources in domestic
life and education.</p>

<p class='c015'>One must regret the lack of proof regarding
many facts, about which are
conflicting statements, both of the general
conditions and the individual men
and women. In some instances, both
points of view have been given here; at
other times, the more probable surmises
have been mentioned.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='vi' id='Page_vi'></span>The author feels deep gratitude, and
would here express it, to the librarians
of the Massachusetts Historical Society,
the New England Genealogic-Historical
Register, the American Antiquarian Society,
the Register of Deeds, Pilgrim
Hall, and the Russell Library of Plymouth,
private and public libraries of
Duxbury and Marshfield, and to Mr.
Arthur Lord and all other individuals
who have assisted in this research. The
publications of the Society of Mayflower
Descendants, and the remarkable researches
of its editor, Mr. George E.
Bowman, call for special appreciation.</p>

<p class='c014'>December weather in New England,
even at its best, is a test of physical
endurance. With warm clothes and
sheltering homes today, we find compensations
for the cold winds and storms
in the exhilarating winter sports and
the good cheer of the holiday season.</p>

<p class='c015'>The passengers of <i>The Mayflower</i>
anchored in Plymouth harbor, three
hundred years ago, lacked compensations
of sports or fireside warmth.
One hundred and two in number when
they sailed,—of whom twenty-nine were
women,—they had been crowded for ten
weeks into a vessel that was intended to
carry about half the number of passengers.
In low spaces between decks,
<span class='pageno' title='4' id='Page_4'></span>with some fine weather when the open
hatchways allowed air to enter and more
stormy days when they were shut in amid
discomforts of all kinds, they had come
at last within sight of the place where,
contrary to their plans, they were destined
to make their settlement.</p>

<p class='c015'>At Plymouth, England, their last port
in September, they had “been kindly
entertained and courteously used by
divers friends there dwelling,”<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c022'><sup>[1]</sup></a> but they
were homeless now, facing a new country
with frozen shores, menaced by wild
animals and yet more fearsome savages.
Whatever trials of their good sense and
sturdy faith came later, those days of
waiting until shelter could be raised on
shore, after the weeks of confinement,
must have challenged their physical and
spiritual fortitude.</p>

<p class='c015'>There must have been exciting days
for the women on shipboard and in landing.
<span class='pageno' title='5' id='Page_5'></span>There must have been hours of
distress for the older and the delight in
adventure which is an unchanging trait
of the young of every race. Wild winds
carried away some clothes and cooking-dishes
from the ship; there was a birth
and a death, and occasional illness, besides
the dire seasickness. John Howland,
“the lustie young man,” fell overboard
but he caught hold of the topsail
halyard which hung extended and so
held on “though he was sundry fathoms
under water,” until he was pulled up by
a rope and rescued by a boat-hook.<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c022'><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c015'>Recent research<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c022'><sup>[3]</sup></a> has argued that the
captain of <i>The Mayflower</i> was probably
not <i>Thomas</i> Jones, with reputation for
severity, but a Master Christopher Jones
of kindlier temper. The former captain
was in Virginia, in September, 1620,
according to this account. With the
most generous treatment which the captain
and crew could give to the women,
<span class='pageno' title='6' id='Page_6'></span>they must have been sorely tried. There
were sick to be nursed, children to be
cared for, including some lively boys
who played with powder and nearly
caused an explosion at Cape Cod; nourishment
must be found for all from a
store of provisions that had been much
reduced by the delays and necessary
sales to satisfy their “merchant adventurers”
before they left England. They
slept on damp bedding and wore musty
clothes; they lacked exercise and water
for drink or cleanliness. Joyful for
them must have been the day recorded
by Winslow and Bradford,<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c022'><sup>[4]</sup></a>—“On Monday
the thirteenth of November our
people went on shore to refresh themselves
and our women to wash, as they
had great need.”</p>

<p class='c015'>During the anxious days when the
abler men were searching on land for a
site for the settlement, first on Cape Cod
and later at Plymouth, there were events
of excitement on the ship left in the
<span class='pageno' title='7' id='Page_7'></span>harbor. Peregrine White was born and
his father’s servant, Edward Thompson,
died. Dorothy May Bradford, the girl-wife
of the later Governor of the colony,
was drowned during his absence. There
were murmurings and threats against the
leaders by some of the crew and others
who were impatient at the long voyage,
scant comforts and uncertain future.
Possibly some of the complaints came
from women, but in the hearts of most
of them, although no women signed their
names, was the resolution that inspired
the men who signed that compact in the
cabin of <i>The Mayflower</i>,—“to promise
all due submission and obedience.” They
had pledged their “great hope and inward
zeal of laying good foundation for
ye propagating and advancing ye gospell
of ye kingdom of Christ in those
remote parts of ye world; yea, though
they should be but as stepping-stones
unto others for ye performing of so
great a work”; with such spirit they had
been impelled to leave Holland and such
<span class='pageno' title='8' id='Page_8'></span>faith sustained them on their long
journey.</p>

<p class='c015'>Many of the women who were
pioneers at Plymouth had suffered
severe hardships in previous years.
They could sustain their own hearts
and encourage the younger ones by remembrance
of the passage from England
to Holland, twelve years before,
when they were searched most cruelly,
even deprived of their clothes and belongings
by the ship’s master at Boston.
Later they were abandoned by the
Dutchman at Hull, to wait for fourteen
days of frightful storm while their husbands
and protectors were carried far
away in a ship towards the coast of
Norway, “their little ones hanging about
them and quaking with cold.”<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c022'><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c015'>There were women with frail bodies,
like Rose Standish and Katherine Carver,
but there were strong physiques
and dauntless hearts sustained to great
old age, matrons like Susanna White
<span class='pageno' title='9' id='Page_9'></span>and Elizabeth Hopkins and young
women like Priscilla Mullins, Mary
Chilton, Elizabeth Tilley and Constance
Hopkins. In our imaginations today,
few women correspond to the clinging,
fainting figures portrayed by some of
the painters of “The Departure” or
“The Landing of the Pilgrims.” We
may more readily believe that most of
the women were upright and alert, peering
anxiously but courageously into the
future. Writing in 1910, John Masefield
said:<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c022'><sup>[6]</sup></a> “A generation fond of
pleasure, disinclined towards serious
thought, and shrinking from hardship,
even if it may be swiftly reached, will
find it difficult to imagine the temper,
courage and manliness of the emigrants
who made the first Christian settlement
of New England.” Ten years ago it
would have been as difficult for women
of our day to understand adequately
the womanliness of the Pilgrim matrons
<span class='pageno' title='10' id='Page_10'></span>and girls. The anxieties and self-denials
experienced by women of all lands during
the last five years may help us to
“imagine” better the dauntless spirit of
these women of New-Plymouth. During
those critical months of 1621-1623
they sustained their households and
assisted the men in establishing an orderly
and religious colony. We may
justly affirm that some of “the wisdom,
prudence and patience and just and
equall carriage of things by the better
part”<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c022'><sup>[7]</sup></a> was manifested among the women
as well as the men.</p>

<p class='c015'>In spite of the spiritual zeal which
comes from devotion to a good cause,
and the inspiration of steady work, the
women must have suffered from homesickness,
as well as from anxiety and
illness. They had left in Holland not
alone their loved pastor, John Robinson,
and their valiant friend, Robert Cushman,
but many fathers, mothers, brothers
and sisters besides their “dear gossips.”
<span class='pageno' title='11' id='Page_11'></span>Mistress Brewster yearned for her elder
son and her daughters, Fear and Patience;
Priscilla Mullins and Mary Chilton,
soon to be left orphans, had been
separated from older brothers and sisters.
Disease stalked among them on
land and on shipboard like a demon.
Before the completion of more than
two or three of the one-room, thatched
houses, the deaths were multiplying.
Possibly this disease was typhus fever;
more probably it was a form of infectious
pneumonia, due to enervated conditions
of the body and to exposures at
Cape Cod. Winslow declared, in his
account of the expedition on shore, “It
blowed and did snow all that day and
night and froze withal. Some of our
people that are dead took the original
of their death there.” Had the disease
been “galloping consumption,” as has
been suggested sometimes, it is not probable
that many of those “sick unto
death” would have recovered and have
lived to be octogenarians.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='12' id='Page_12'></span>The toll of deaths increased and the
illness spread until, at one time, there
were only “six or seven sound persons”
to minister to the sick and to bury the
dead. Fifteen of the twenty-nine women
who sailed from England and Holland
were buried on Plymouth hillside during
the winter and spring. They were:

Nearly twice as many men as women
died during those fateful months of
1621. Can we “imagine” the courage
required by the few women who remained
after this devastation, as the
<span class='pageno' title='13' id='Page_13'></span>wolves were heard howling in the night,
the food supplies were fast disappearing,
and the houses of shelter were delayed
in completion by “frost and much foul
weather,” and by the very few men in
physical condition to rive timber or
to thatch roofs? The common house,
twenty foot square, was crowded with
the sick, among them Carver and Bradford,
who were obliged “to rise in good
speed” when the roof caught on fire,
and their loaded muskets in rows beside
the beds threatened an explosion.<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c022'><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c015'>Although the women’s strength of
body and soul must have been sapped
yet their fidelity stood well the test;
when <i>The Mayflower</i> was to return to
England in April and the captain offered
free passage to the women as well
as to any men who wished to go, if the
women “would cook and nurse such of
the crew as were ill,” not a man or a
woman accepted the offer. Intrepid in
bravery and faith, the women did their
<span class='pageno' title='14' id='Page_14'></span>part in making this lonely, impoverished
settlement into a home. This required
adjustments of many kinds. Few in
number, the women represented distinctive
classes of society in birth and
education. In Leyden, for seven years,
they had chosen their friends and there
they formed a happy community, in
spite of some poverty and more anxiety
about the education and morals of their
children, because of “the manifold
temptations”<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c022'><sup>[9]</sup></a> of the Dutch city.</p>

<p class='c015'>Many of the men, on leaving England,
had renounced their more leisurely
occupations and professions to practise
trades in Leyden,—Brewster and Winslow
as printers, Allerton as tailor, Dr.
Samuel Fuller as say-weaver and others
as carpenters, wool-combers, masons,
cobblers, pewterers and in other crafts.
A few owned residences near the famous
University of Leyden, where Robinson
and Brewster taught. Some educational
influences would thus fall upon their
<span class='pageno' title='15' id='Page_15'></span>families.<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c022'><sup>[10]</sup></a> On the other hand, others
were recorded as “too poor to be taxed.”
Until July, 1620, there were two hundred
and ninety-eight known members
of this church in Leyden with nearly
three hundred more associated with
them. Such economic and social conditions
gave to the women certain privileges
and pleasures in addition to the
interesting events in this picturesque
city.</p>

<p class='c015'>In <i>The Mayflower</i> and at Plymouth,
on the other hand, the women were
thrust into a small company with widely
differing tastes and backgrounds. One
of the first demands made upon them
was for a democratic spirit,—tolerance
and patience, adaptability to varied natures.
The old joke that “the Pilgrim
Mothers had to endure not alone their
hardships but the Pilgrim Fathers also”
has been overworked. These women
would never have accepted pity as martyrs.
<span class='pageno' title='16' id='Page_16'></span>They came to this new country
with devotion to the men of their families
and, in those days, such a call was supreme
in a woman’s life. They sorrowed
for the women friends who had been left
behind,—the wives of Dr. Fuller, Richard
Warren, Francis Cooke and Degory
Priest, who were to come later after
months of anxious waiting for a message
from New-Plymouth.</p>

<p class='c015'>The family, not the individual, characterized
the life of that community.
The father was always regarded as the
“head” of the family. Evidence of this
is found when we try to trace the posterity
of some of the pioneer women
from the Old Plymouth Colony Records.
A child is there recorded as “the son
of Nicholas Snow,” “the son of John
Winslow” or “the daughter of Thomas
Cushman” with no hint that the mothers
of these children were, respectively,
Constance Hopkins, Mary Chilton and
Mary Allerton, all of whom came in
<i>The Mayflower</i>, although the fathers
<span class='pageno' title='17' id='Page_17'></span>arrived at Plymouth later on <i>The Fortune</i>
and <i>The Ann</i>.</p>

<p class='c015'>It would be unjust to assume that
these women were conscious heroines.
They wrought with courage and purpose
equal to these traits in the men, but
probably none of the Pilgrims had
a definite vision of the future. With
words of appreciation that are applicable
to both sexes, ex-President Charles W.
Eliot has said:<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c022'><sup>[11]</sup></a> “The Pilgrims did not
know the issue and they had no vision of
it. They just loved liberty and toleration
and truth, and hoped for more of it,
for more liberty, for a more perfect
toleration, for more truth, and they put
their lives, their labors, at the disposition
of those loves without the least vision of
this republic, or of what was going to
come out of their industry, their devotion,
their dangerous and exposed lives.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Spring and summer came to bless
them for their endurance and unconscious
heroism. Then they could appreciate
the verdict of their leaders, who
chose the site of Plymouth as a “hopeful
place,” with running brooks, vines of
sassafras and strawberry, fruit trees,
fish and wild fowl and “clay excellent
for pots and will wash like soap.”<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c022'><sup>[12]</sup></a> So
early was the spring in 1621 that on
March the third there was a thunder
storm and “the birds sang in the woods
most pleasantly.” On March the sixteenth,
Samoset came with Indian greeting.
This visit must have been one of
mixed sentiments for the women and we
can read more than the mere words in
the sentence, “We lodged him that night
<span class='pageno' title='22' id='Page_22'></span>at Stephen Hopkins’ house and watched
him.”<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c022'><sup>[13]</sup></a> Perhaps it was in deference to
the women that the men gave Samoset
a hat, a pair of stockings, shoes, a
shirt and a piece of cloth to tie about
his waist. Samoset returned soon with
Squanto or Tisquantum, the only survivor
of the Patuxet tribe of Indians
which had perished of a pestilence at
Plymouth three years before. He
shared with Hobomok the friendship of
the settlers for many years and both
Indians gave excellent service. Through
the influence of Squanto the treaty was
made in the spring of 1621 with Massasoit,
the first League of Nations to
preserve peace in the new world.</p>

<p class='c015'>Squanto showed the men how to plant
alewives or herring as fertilizer for the
Indian corn. He taught the boys and
girls how to gather clams and mussels
on the shore and to “tread eels” in the
water that is still called Eel River. He
gathered wild strawberries and sassafras
<span class='pageno' title='23' id='Page_23'></span>for the women and they prepared a
“brew” which almost equalled their ale
of old England. The friendly Indians
assisted the men, as the seasons opened,
in hunting wild turkeys, ducks and an
occasional deer, welcome additions to the
store of fish, sea-biscuits and cheese.
We are told<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c022'><sup>[14]</sup></a> that Squanto brought also
a dog from his Indian friends as a gift
to the settlement. Already there were,
at least, two dogs, probably brought
from Holland or England, a mastiff
and a spaniel<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c022'><sup>[15]</sup></a> to give comfort and companionship
to the women and children,
and to go with the men into the woods
for timber and game.</p>

<p class='c015'>It seems paradoxical to speak of
child-life in this hard-pressed, serious-minded
colony, but it was there and,
doubtless, it was normal in its joyous
and adventuresome impulses. Under
eighteen years of age were the girls,
Remember and Mary Allerton, Constance
and Damaris Hopkins, Elizabeth
<span class='pageno' title='24' id='Page_24'></span>Tilley and, possibly, Desire Minter and
Humility Cooper. The boys were Bartholomew
Allerton, who “learned to
sound the drum,” John Crakston,
William Latham, Giles Hopkins, John
and Francis Billington, Richard More,
Henry Sampson, John Cooke, Resolved
White, Samuel Fuller, Love and Wrestling
Brewster and the babies, Oceanus
Hopkins and Peregrine White. With
the exception of Wrestling Brewster
and Oceanus Hopkins, all these children
lived to ripe old age,—a credit not alone
to their hardy constitutions, but also to
the care which the Plymouth women
bestowed upon their households.</p>

<p class='c015'>The flowers that grew in abundance
about the settlement must have given
them joy,—arbutus or “mayflowers,”
wild roses, blue chicory, Queen Anne’s
lace, purple asters, golden-rod and the
beautiful sabbatia or “sentry” which is
still found on the banks of the fresh
ponds near the town and is called
“the Plymouth rose.” Edward Winslow
<span class='pageno' title='25' id='Page_25'></span>tells<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c022'><sup>[16]</sup></a> of the drastic use of this bitter
plant in developing hardihood among
Indian boys. Early in the first year
one of these fresh-water ponds, known
as Billington Sea, was discovered by
Francis Billington when he had climbed
a high hill and had reported from it “a
smaller sea.” Blackberries, blueberries,
plums and cherries must have been delights
to the women and children.
Medicinal herbs were found and used
by advice of the Indian friends; the
bayberry’s virtues as salve, if not as
candle-light, were early applied to the
comforts of the households. Robins,
bluebirds, “Bob Whites” and other birds
sang for the pioneers as they sing for
the tourist and resident in Plymouth
today. The mosquito had a sting,—for
Bradford gave a droll and pungent answer
to the discontented colonists who
had reported, in 1624, that “the people
are much annoyed with musquetoes.”
He wrote:<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c022'><sup>[17]</sup></a> “<i>They</i> are too delicate and
<span class='pageno' title='26' id='Page_26'></span>unfitte to begin new plantations and
colonies that cannot enduer the biting
of a muskeet. We would wish such to
keep at home till at least they be muskeeto
proof. Yet this place is as free as
any and experience teacheth that ye land
is tild and ye woods cut downe, the
fewer there will be and in the end scarce
any at all.” The <i>end</i> has not yet come!</p>

<p class='c015'>Good harvests and some thrilling incidents
varied the hard conditions of life
for the women during 1621-2. Indian
corn and barley furnished a new foundation
for many “a savory dish” prepared
by the housewives in the mortar and
pestles, kettles and skillets which they
had brought from Holland. Nuts were
used for food, giving piquant flavor both
to “cakes” baked in the fire and to the
stuffing of wild turkeys. The fare was
simple, but it must have seemed a feast
to the Pilgrims after the months of self-denials
and extremity.</p>

<p class='c015'>Before the winter of 1621-2 was
ended, seven log houses had been built
<span class='pageno' title='27' id='Page_27'></span>and four “common buildings” for storage,
meetings and workshops. Already
clapboards and furs were stored to be
sent back to England to the merchant
adventurers in the first ship. The seven
huts, with thatched roofs and chimneys
on the outside, probably in cob-house
style, were of hewn planks, not of round
logs.<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c022'><sup>[18]</sup></a> The fireplaces were of stones laid
in clay from the abundant sand. In
1628 thatched roofs were condemned
because of the danger of fire,<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c022'><sup>[19]</sup></a> and
boards or palings were substituted.
During the first two years or longer,
light came into the houses through oiled
paper in the windows. From the plans
left by Governor Bradford and the
record of the visit of De Rassieres to
Plymouth, in 1627, one can visualize this
first street in New England, leading
from Plymouth harbor up the hill to the
cannon and stockade where, later, was
the fort. At the intersection of the first
street and a cross-highway stood the
<span class='pageno' title='28' id='Page_28'></span>Governor’s house. It was fitting that
the lot nearest to the fort hill should be
assigned to Miles Standish and John
Alden. All had free access to the brook
where flagons were filled for drink and
where the clothes were washed.</p>

<p class='c015'>A few events that have been recorded
by Winslow, Bradford and Morton were
significant and must have relieved the
monotony of life. On January fourth
an eagle was shot, cooked and proved
“to be excellent meat; it was hardly
to be discerned from mutton.”<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c022'><sup>[20]</sup></a> Four
days later three seals and a cod were
caught; we may assume that they furnished
oil, meat and skins for the household.
About the same time, John Goodman
and Peter Brown lost their way in
the woods, remained out all night, thinking
they heard lions roar (mistaking
wolves for lions), and on their return
the next day John Goodman’s feet were
so badly frozen “that it was a long time
before he was able to go.”<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c022'><sup>[21]</sup></a> Wild geese
<span class='pageno' title='29' id='Page_29'></span>were shot and used for broth on the
ninth of February; the same day the
Common House was set ablaze, but was
saved from destruction. It is easy to
imagine the exciting effects of such incidents
upon the band of thirteen boys
and seven girls, already enumerated. In
July, the cry of “a lost child” aroused
the settlement to a search for that “unwhipt
rascal,” John Billington, who had
run away to the Nauset Indians at Eastham,
but he was found unharmed by a
posse of men led by Captain Standish.</p>

<p class='c015'>To the women one of the most exciting
events must have been the marriage
on May 22, 1621, of Edward Winslow
and Mistress Susanna White. Her husband
and two men-servants had died
since <i>The Mayflower</i> left England and
she was alone to care for two young
boys, one a baby a few weeks old.
Elizabeth Barker Winslow had died
seven weeks before the wedding day.
Perhaps the Plymouth women gossiped
a little over the brief interval of mourning,
<span class='pageno' title='30' id='Page_30'></span>but the exigencies of the times easily
explained the marriage, which was performed
by a magistrate, presumably the
Governor.</p>

<p class='c015'>Even more disturbing to the peaceful
life was the first duel on June 18,
between Edward Lister and Edward
Dotey, both servants of Stephen Hopkins.
Tradition ascribed the cause to
a quarrel over the attractive elder
daughter of their master, Constance
Hopkins. The duel was fought with
swords and daggers; both youths were
slightly wounded in hand and thigh and
both were sentenced, as punishment, to
have their hands and feet tied together
and to fast for twenty-four hours but,
says a record,<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c022'><sup>[22]</sup></a> “within an hour, because
of their great pains, at their own and
their master’s humble request, upon
promise of better carriage, they were
released by the Governor.” It is easy
to imagine this scene: Stephen Hopkins
and his wife appealing to the Governor
<span class='pageno' title='31' id='Page_31'></span>and Captain Standish for leniency, although
the settlement was seriously
troubled over the occurrence; Elder
Brewster and his wife deploring the
lack of Christian affection which caused
the duel; Edward Winslow and his
wife, dignified yet tolerant; Goodwife
Helen Billington scolding as usual;
Priscilla Mullins, Mary Chilton and
Elizabeth Tilley condoling with the tearful
and frightened Constance Hopkins,
while the children stand about, excited
and somewhat awed by the punishment
and the distress of the offenders.</p>

<p class='c015'>Another day of unusual interest and
industry for the householders was the
Thanksgiving Day when peace with the
Indians and assured prosperity seemed
to follow the ample harvests. To this
feast, which lasted for three days or
more, came ninety-one Indians bringing
five deer which they had killed and
dressed. These were a great boon to the
women who must prepare meals for
one hundred and forty people. Wild
<span class='pageno' title='32' id='Page_32'></span>turkeys, ducks, fish and clams were
procured by the colonists and cooked,
perhaps with some marchpanes also, by
the more expert cooks. The serious
prayers and psalms of the Pilgrims were
as amazing to the Indians as were
the strange whoops, dances, beads and
feathers of the savages marvellous to
the women and children of Plymouth
Colony.</p>

<p class='c015'>In spite of these peaceable incidents
there were occasional threats of Indian
treachery, like the theft of tools from
two woodsmen and the later bold challenge
in the form of a headless arrow
wrapped in a snake’s skin; the latter
was returned promptly and decisively
with the skin filled with bullets, and the
danger was over for a time. The stockade
was strengthened and, soon after,
a palisade was built about the houses
with gates that were locked at night.
After the fort of heavy timber was
completed, this was used also as a meeting-house
and “was fitted accordingly
<span class='pageno' title='33' id='Page_33'></span>for that use.” It is to be hoped that
warming-pans and foot-stoves were a
part of the “fittings” so that the women
might not be benumbed as, with dread
of possible Indian attacks, they limned
from the old Ainsworth’s Psalm Book:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c024'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“In the Lord do I trust, how then to my soule doe ye say,</div>
      <div class='line'>As doth a little bird unto your mountaine fly away?</div>
      <div class='line'>For loe, the wicked bend their bow, their arrows they prepare</div>
      <div class='line'>On string; to shoot at dark at them</div>
      <div class='line'>In heart that upright are.”</div>
      <div class='c025'>(<i>Psalm xi.</i>)</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Even more exciting than the days already
mentioned was the great event of
surprise and rejoicing, November 19,
1621, when <i>The Fortune</i> arrived with
thirty-five more Pilgrims. Some of
these were soon to wed <i>Mayflower</i> passengers.
Widow Martha Ford, recently
bereft, giving birth on the night of her
arrival to a fourth child, was wed to
Peter Brown; Mary Becket (sometimes
<span class='pageno' title='34' id='Page_34'></span>written Bucket) became the wife of
George Soule; John Winslow later married
Mary Chilton, and Thomas Cushman,
then a lad of fourteen, became the
husband, in manhood, of Mary Allerton.
His father, Robert Cushman, remained
in the settlement while <i>The Fortune</i> was
at anchor and left his son as ward for
Governor Bradford. The notable sermon
which was preached at Plymouth
by Robert Cushman at this time (preserved
in Pilgrim Hall, Plymouth) was
from the text, “Let no man seek his
own; but every man another’s wealth.”
Some of the admonitions against swelling
pride and fleshly-minded hypocrites
seem to us rather paradoxical when we
consider the poverty and self-sacrificing
spirit of these pioneers; perhaps, there
were selfish and slothful malcontents
even in that company of devoted, industrious
men and women, for human nature
was the same three hundred years
ago, in large and small communities, as
it is today, with some relative changes.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='35' id='Page_35'></span>Among the passengers brought by
<i>The Fortune</i> were some of great helpfulness.
William Wright, with his wife
Priscilla (the sister of Governor Bradford’s
second wife), was an expert carpenter,
and Stephen Dean, who came
with his wife, was able to erect a small
mill and grind corn. Robert Hicks (or
Heeks) was another addition to the
colony, whose wife was later the teacher
of some of the children. Philip De La
Noye, progenitor of the Delano family
in America, John and Kenelm Winslow
and Jonathan Brewster were eligible
men to join the group of younger
men,—John Alden, John Howland and
others.</p>

<p class='c015'>The great joy in the arrival of these
friends was succeeded by an agitating
fear regarding the food supply, for <i>The
Fortune</i> had suffered from bad weather
and its colonists had scarcely any extra
food or clothing. By careful allotments
the winter was endured and when spring
came there were hopes of a large harvest
<span class='pageno' title='36' id='Page_36'></span>from more abundant sowing, but the
hopes were killed by the fearful drought
which lasted from May to the middle of
July. Some lawless and selfish youths
frequently stole corn before it was ripe
and, although public whipping was the
punishment, the evil persisted. These
conditions were met with the same courage
and determination which ever characterized
the leaders; a rationing of the
colony was made which would have done
credit to a “Hoover.” They escaped
famine, but the worn, thin faces and
“the low condition, both in respect of
food and clothing” was a shock to the
sixty more colonists who arrived in <i>The
Ann</i> and <i>The James</i> in 1623.</p>

<p class='c015'>The friends who came in these later
ships included some women from Leyden,
“dear gossips” of <i>Mayflower</i>
colonists, women whose resources and
characters gave them prominence in the
later history of Plymouth. Notable
among them was Mrs. Alice Southworth,
soon to wed Governor Bradford. With
<span class='pageno' title='37' id='Page_37'></span>her came Barbara, whose surname is
surmised to have been Standish, soon to
become the wife of Captain Standish.
Bridget Fuller joined her husband, the
noble doctor of Plymouth; Elizabeth
Warren, with her five daughters, came
to make a home for her husband, Richard;
Mistress Hester Cooke came with
three children, and Fear and Patience
Brewster, despite their names, brought
joy and cheer to their mother and girlhood
friends; they were later wed to
Isaac Allerton and Thomas Prence, the
Governor.</p>

<p class='c015'>Fortunately, <i>The Ann</i> and <i>The James</i>
brought supplies in liberal measure and
also carpenters, weavers and cobblers,
for their need was great. <i>The James</i>
was to remain for the use of the colony.
Rations had been as low as one-quarter
pound of bread a day and sometimes
their fare was only “a bit of fish or
lobster without any bread or relish but
a cup of fair spring water.”<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c022'><sup>[23]</sup></a> It is
<span class='pageno' title='38' id='Page_38'></span>not strange that Bradford added: “ye
long continuance of this diete and
their labors abroad had somewhat
abated ye freshness of their former
complexion.”</p>

<p class='c015'>An important change in the policy
of the colony, which affected the women
as well as men, was made at this time.
Formerly the administration of affairs
had been upon the communal basis. All
the men and grown boys were expected
to plant and harvest, fish and
hunt for the common use of all the
households. The women also did their
tasks in common. The results had been
unsatisfactory and, in 1623, a new division
of land was made, allotting to each
householder an acre for each member
of his family. This arrangement, which
was called “every man for his owne particuler,”
was told by Bradford with a
comment which shows that the women
were human beings, not saints nor martyrs.
He wrote: “The women now
went willingly into ye field, and tooke
<span class='pageno' title='39' id='Page_39'></span>their little-ones with them to set corne,
which before would aledge weaknes
and inabilitie; whom to have compelled
would have bene thought great tiranie
and oppression.” After further comment
upon the failure of communism
as “breeding confusion and discontent”
he added this significant comment: “For
ye yong-men that were most able and
fitte for labour and service did repine
that they should spend their time and
strength to work for other men’s wives
and children without any recompense....
And for men’s wives to be commanded
to doe servise for other men,
as dresing their meate, washing their
cloathes, etc., they deemed it a kind of
slaverie, neither could many husbands
well brooke it.”</p>

<p class='c015'>If food was scarce, even a worse condition
existed as to clothing in the summer
of 1623. Tradition has ascribed
several spinning-wheels and looms to
the women who came in <i>The Mayflower</i>,
but we can scarcely believe that such
<span class='pageno' title='40' id='Page_40'></span>comforts were generously bestowed.
There could have been little material
or time for their use. Much skilful weaving
and spinning of linen, flax, and
wool came in later Colonial history. The
women must have been taxed to keep
the clothes mended for their families
as protection against the cold and
storms. The quantity on hand, after
the stress of the two years, would vary
according to the supplies which each
brought from Holland or England; in
some families there were sheets and
“pillow-beeres” with “clothes of substance
and comeliness,” but other households
were scantily supplied. A somewhat
crude but interesting ballad, called
“Our Forefathers’ Song,” is given by
tradition from the lips of an old lady,
aged ninety-four years, in 1767. If the
suggestion is accurate that she learned
this from her mother or grandmother,
its date would approximate the early
days of Plymouth history. More probably
it was written much later, but it
<span class='pageno' title='41' id='Page_41'></span>has a reminiscent flavor of those days
of poverty and brave spirit:</p>

<p class='c015'>What did these Pilgrim women wear?
The manifest answer is,—what they had
in stock. No more absurd idea was ever
invented than the picture of these Pilgrims
“in uniform,” gray gowns with
dainty white collars and cuffs, with stiff
caps and dark capes. They wore the
typical garments of the period for men
and women in England. There is no
evidence that they adopted, to any extent,
Dutch dress, for they were proud
of their English birth; they left Holland
partly for fear that their young people
might be educated or enticed away from
English standards of conduct.<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c022'><sup>[25]</sup></a> Mrs.
Alice Morse Earle has emphasized
wisely<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c022'><sup>[26]</sup></a> that the “sad-colored” gowns
and coats mentioned in wills were not
“dismal”; the list of colors so described
<span class='pageno' title='43' id='Page_43'></span>in England included (1638) “russet,
purple, green, tawny, deere colour,
orange colour, buffs and scarlet.” The
men wore doublets and jerkins of
browns and greens, and cloaks with red
and purple linings. The women wore
full skirts of say, paduasoy or silk of
varied colors, long, pointed stomachers,—often
with bright tone,—full, sometimes
puffed or slashed sleeves, and lace
collars or “whisks” resting upon the
shoulders. Sometimes the gowns were
plaited or silk-laced; they often opened
in front showing petticoats that were
quilted or embroidered in brighter
colours. Broadcloth gowns of russet
tones were worn by those who could not
afford silks and satins; sometimes
women wore doublets and jerkins of
black and browns. For dress occasions
the men wore black velvet jerkins with
white ruffs, like those in the authentic
portrait of Edward Winslow. Velvet
and quilted hoods of all colors and sometimes
caps, flat on the head and meeting
<span class='pageno' title='44' id='Page_44'></span>below the chin with fullness, are shown
in existent portraits of English women
and early colonists.</p>

<p class='c015'>Among relics that are dated back to
this early period are the slipper<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c022'><sup>[27]</sup></a> belonging
to Mistress Susanna White
Winslow, narrow, pointed, with lace
trimmings, and an embroidered lace cap
that has been assigned to Rose Standish.<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c022'><sup>[28]</sup></a>
Sometimes the high ruffs were
worn above the shoulders instead of
“whisks.” The children were dressed
like miniature men and women; often
the girls wore aprons, as did the women
on occasions; these were narrow and
edged with lace. “Petty coats” are
mentioned in wills among the garments
of the women. We would not assume
that in 1621-2 <i>all</i> the women in Plymouth
colony wore silken or even home-spun
clothes of prevailing English
fashion. Many of these that are mentioned
in inventories and retained as
heirlooms, with rich laces and embroideries,
<span class='pageno' title='45' id='Page_45'></span>were brought later from England;
probably Winslow, Allerton and even
Standish brought back such gifts to the
women when they made their trips
to England in 1624 and later. If the
pioneer women had laces and embroideries
of gold they probably hoarded them
as precious heirlooms during those early
years of want, for they were too sensible
to wear and to waste them. As prosperity
came, however, and new elements
entered the colony they were, doubtless,
affected by the law of the General
Court, in 1634, which forbade further
acquisition of laces, threads of silver and
gold, needle-work caps, bands and rails,
and silver girdles and belts. This law
was enacted <i>not</i> by the Pilgrims of
Plymouth, but by the Puritans of Massachusetts
Bay Colony.</p>

<p class='c015'>When Edward Winslow returned in
<i>The Charity</i>, in 1624, he brought not
alone a “goodly supply of clothing”<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c022'><sup>[29]</sup></a>
but,—far more important,—the first bull
<span class='pageno' title='46' id='Page_46'></span>and heifers that were in Plymouth.
The old tradition of the white bull on
which Priscilla Alden rode home from
her marriage, in 1622 or early 1623,
must be rejected. This valuable addition
of “neat cattle” to the resources of
the colony caused a redistribution of
land and shares in the “stock.” By 1627
a partnership or “purchas” had been
arranged, for assuming the debts and
maintenance of the Plymouth colony,
freed from further responsibility to “the
adventurers” in London. The new
division of lots included also some of
the cattle. It was specified, for instance,
that Captain Standish and Edward
Winslow were to share jointly “the Red
Cow which belongeth to the poor of the
colony to which they must keep her
Calfe of this yeare being a Bull for the
Companie, Also two shee goats.”<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c022'><sup>[30]</sup></a>
Elder Brewster was granted “one of
the four Heifers came in <i>The Jacob</i>
called the Blind Heifer.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Among interesting sidelights upon the
<span class='pageno' title='47' id='Page_47'></span>economic and social results of this extension
of land and cattle is the remark
of Bradford:<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c022'><sup>[31]</sup></a> “Some looked for building
great houses, and such pleasant
situations for them as themselves had
fancied, as if they would be great men
and rich all of a suddaine; but they
proved castles in air.” Within a short
time, however, with the rapid increase
of children and the need of more pasturage
for the cattle, many of the leading
men and women drifted away from
the original confines of Plymouth towards
Duxbury, Marshfield, Scituate,
Bridgewater and Eastham. Agriculture
became their primal concern, with the
allied pursuits of fishing, hunting and
trading with the Indians and white settlements
that were made on Cape Cod
and along the Kennebec.</p>

<p class='c015'>Soon after 1630 the families of
Captain Standish, John Alden, and
Jonathan Brewster (who had married
the sister of John Oldham), Thomas
Prence and Edward Winslow were settled
<span class='pageno' title='48' id='Page_48'></span>on large farms in Duxbury and
Marshfield. This loss to the Plymouth
settlement was deplored by Bradford
both for its social and religious results.
April 2, 1632,<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c022'><sup>[32]</sup></a> a pledge was taken by
Alden, Standish, Prence, and Jonathan
Brewster that they would “remove their
families to live in the towne in the
winter-time that they may the better
repair to the service of God.” Such
arrangement did not long continue, however,
for in 1633 a church was established
at Duxbury and the Plymouth
members who lived there “were dismiste
though very unwillingly.”<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c022'><sup>[33]</sup></a> Later the
families of Francis Eaton, Peter Brown
and George Soule joined the Duxbury
colony. Hobomok, ever faithful to Captain
Standish had a wigwam near his
master’s home until, in his old age, he
was removed to the Standish house,
where he died in 1642.</p>

<p class='c015'>The women who had come in the
<span class='pageno' title='49' id='Page_49'></span>earlier ships and had lived close to
neighbors at Plymouth must have had
lonely hours on their farms in spite of
large families and many tasks. Wolves
and other wild animals were sometimes
near, for traps for them were decreed
and allotted. Chance Indians prowled
about and the stoutest hearts must have
quailed when some of the recorded hurricanes
and storms of 1635 and 1638
uncovered houses, felled trees and corn.
In the main, however, there was peace
and many of the families became prosperous;
we find evidence in their wills,
several of which have been deciphered
from the original records by George
Ernest Bowman, editor of the <a id='err059'></a>“Mayflower
Descendant,”<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c022'><sup>[34]</sup></a> issued quarterly.
By the aid of such records and a few
family heirlooms of unquestioned genuineness,
it is possible to suggest some individual
silhouettes of the women of early
Plymouth, in addition to the glimpses of
their communal life.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>It has been said, with some justice,
that the Pilgrims were not remarkable
men, that they lacked genius or distinctive
personalities. The same statement
may be made about the women.
They did possess, as men and women,
fine qualities for the work which they
were destined to accomplish;—remarkable
energy, faith, purpose, courage and
patience. These traits were prominent
in the leaders, Carver and Bradford.
Standish and Winslow, Brewster and
Dr. Fuller. As assistants to the men
in the civic life of the colony, there were
a few women who influenced the domestic
and social affairs of their own and
later generations. From chance records,
wills, inventories and traditions their
<span class='pageno' title='54' id='Page_54'></span>individual traits must be discerned, for
there is scarcely any sequential, historic
record.</p>

<p class='c015'>Death claimed some of these brave-hearted
women before the life at Plymouth
really began. Dorothy May Bradford,
the daughter of Deacon May of
the Leyden church, came from Wisbeach,
Cambridge; she was married to
William Bradford when she was about
sixteen years old and was only twenty
when she was drowned at Cape Cod.
Her only child, a son, John, was left
with her father and mother in Holland
and there was long a tradition that she
mourned grievously at the separation.
This son came later to Plymouth, about
1627, and lived in Marshfield and
Norwich, Connecticut.</p>

<p class='c015'>The tiny pieces of a padded quilt with
faded threads of silver and gold, which
belonged to Rose Standish,<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c022'><sup>[35]</sup></a> are fitting
relics of this mystical, delicate wife of
“the doughty Captain.” She died January
<span class='pageno' title='55' id='Page_55'></span>29, 1621. She is portrayed in fiction
and poetry as proud of her husband’s
bravery and his record as a
Lieutenant of Queen Elizabeth’s forces
in aid of the Dutch. She was also proud
of his reputed, and disputed, inheritance
among the titled families of Standish
of Standish and Standish of Duxbury
Hall.<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c022'><sup>[36]</sup></a> There has been a persistent
tradition that Rose was born or lived on
the Isle of Man and was married there,
but no records have been found as
proofs.</p>

<p class='c015'>In the painting of “The Embarkation,”
by Robert Weir, Elizabeth
Barker, the young wife of Edward
Winslow, is attired in gay colors and
extreme fashion, while beside her stands
a boy of about eight years with a canteen
strapped over his shoulders. It has
been stated that this is the silver canteen,
marked “E. W.,” now in the cabinet of
<span class='pageno' title='56' id='Page_56'></span>the Massachusetts Historical Society.
The only record <i>there</i> is<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c022'><sup>[37]</sup></a> “presentation,
June, 1870, by James Warren, Senr.,
of a silver canteen and pewter plate
which once belonged to Gov. Edward
Winslow with his arms and initials.”
As Elizabeth Barker, who came from
Chatsun or Chester, England, to Holland,
was married April 3, 1618, to
Winslow,<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c022'><sup>[38]</sup></a> and as she was his first wife,
the son must have been a baby when
<i>The Mayflower</i> sailed. Moreover, there
is no record by Bradford of any child
that came with the Winslows, except the
orphan, Ellen More. It has been suggested
that the latter was of noble
lineage.<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c022'><sup>[39]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c015'>Mary Norris, of Newbury in England,
wife of one of the wealthiest and
most prominent of the Pilgrims in
early years, Isaac Allerton, died in February
of the first winter, leaving two
young girls, Remember and Mary, and
<span class='pageno' title='57' id='Page_57'></span>a son, Bartholomew or “Bart.” The
daughters married well, Remember to
Moses Maverick of Salem, and Mary
to Thomas Cushman. Mrs. Allerton
gave birth to a child that was still-born
while on <i>The Mayflower</i> and thus she
had less strength to endure the hardships
which followed.<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c022'><sup>[40]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c015'>When Bradford, recording the death
of Katherine Carver, called her a “weak
woman,” he referred to her health which
was delicate while she lived at Plymouth
and could not withstand the grief and
shock of her husband’s death in April.
She died the next month. She has been
called “a gracious woman” in another
record of her death.<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c022'><sup>[41]</sup></a> She was the sister
or sister-in-law of John Robinson, their
pastor in England and Holland. Recent
investigation has claimed that she
was first married to George Legatt and
later to Carver.<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c022'><sup>[42]</sup></a> Two children died and
<span class='pageno' title='58' id='Page_58'></span>were buried in Holland in 1609 and 1617
and, apparently, these were the only
children born to the Carvers. The maid,
Lois, who came with them on <i>The Mayflower</i>,
is supposed to have married
Francis Eaton, but she did not live long
after 1622. Desire Minter, who was
also of the Carver household, has been
the victim of much speculation. Mrs.
Jane G. Austin, in her novel, “Standish
of Standish,” makes her the female
scapegrace of the colony, jealous, discontented
and quarrelsome. On the
other hand, and still speculatively, she is
portrayed as the elder sister and housekeeper
for John Howland and Elizabeth
Tilley, after the death of Mistress
Carver; this is assumed because the first
girl born to the Howlands was named
Desire.<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c022'><sup>[43]</sup></a> The only known facts about
Desire Minter are those given by Bradford,
“she returned to friends and proved
not well, and dyed in England.”<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c022'><sup>[44]</sup></a> By
research among the Leyden records,
<span class='pageno' title='59' id='Page_59'></span>collated by H. M. Dexter,<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c022'><sup>[45]</sup></a> the name,
Minter, occurs a few times. William
Minter, the husband of Sarah, was associated
with the Carvers and Chiltons in
marriage betrothals. William Minter
was purchaser of a house from William
Jeppson, in Leyden, in 1614. Another
record is of a student at the University
of Leyden who lived at the house of
John Minter. Another reference to
Thomas Minter of Sandwich, Kent, may
furnish a clue.<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c022'><sup>[46]</sup></a> Evidently, to some of
these relatives, with property, near or
distant of kin, Desire Minter returned
before 1626.</p>

<p class='c015'>Another unmarried woman, who survived
the hardships of the first winter,
but returned to England and died there,
was Humility Cooper. We know almost
nothing about her except that she
and Henry Sampson were cousins of
Edward Tilley and his wife. She is also
mentioned as a relative of Richard Clopton,
<span class='pageno' title='60' id='Page_60'></span>one of the early religious leaders in
England.<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c022'><sup>[47]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c015'>The “mother” of this group of matrons
and maidens, who survived the
winters of 1621-2, was undoubtedly
Mistress Mary Brewster. Wife of the
Elder, she shared his religious faith and
zeal, and exercised a strong moral influence
upon the women and children.
Pastor John Robinson, in a letter to
Governor Bradford, in 1623, refers to
“her weake and decayed state of body,”
but she lived until April 17, 1627, according
to records in “the Brewster
Book.” She was only fifty-seven years
at her death but, as Bradford said with
tender appreciation, “her great and continuall
labours, with other crosses and
sorrows, hastened it before y<sup>e</sup> time.” As
Elder Brewster “could fight as well as
he could pray,” could build his own
house and till his own land,<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c022'><sup>[48]</sup></a> so, we may
believe, his wife was efficient in all
domestic ways. When her strength
<span class='pageno' title='61' id='Page_61'></span>failed, it is pleasant to think that she
accepted graciously the loving assistance
of the younger women to whom she
must have seemed, in her presence, like
a benediction. Her married life was
fruitful; five children lived to maturity
and two or more had died in Holland.
The Elder was “wise and discreet and
well-spoken—of a cheerful spirit, sociable
and pleasant among his friends,
undervaluing himself and his abilities
and sometimes overvaluing others.”<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c022'><sup>[49]</sup></a>
Such a person is sure to be a delightful
companion. To these attractive qualities
the Elder added another proof of tact
and wisdom: “He always thought it
were better for ministers to pray oftener
and divide their prayers, than be long
and tedious in the same.”</p>

<p class='c015'>While Mistress Brewster did not excel
the women of her day, probably, in education,—for
to read easily and to write
were not considered necessary graces for
even the better-bred classes,—she could
<span class='pageno' title='62' id='Page_62'></span>appreciate the thirty-eight copies of the
Scriptures which were found among her
husband’s four hundred volumes; <i>these</i>
would be familiar to her, but the sixty-four
books in Latin would not be read
by the women of her day. Fortunately,
she did not survive, as did her husband,
to endure grief from the deaths of
the daughters, Fear and Patience, both
of whom died before 1635; nor yet did
she realize the bitterness of feeling between
the sons, Jonathan and Love, and
their differences of opinion in the settlement
of the Elder’s estate.<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c022'><sup>[50]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c015'>A traditional picture has been given<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c022'><sup>[51]</sup></a>
of Captain Peregrine White of Marshfield,
“riding a black horse and wearing
a coat with buttons the size of a silver
dollar, vigorous and of a comely aspect
to the last,”<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c022'><sup>[52]</sup></a> paying daily visits to his
mother, Mistress Susanna White Winslow.
We may imagine this elderly matron,
<span class='pageno' title='63' id='Page_63'></span>sitting in the Winslow arm-chair,
with its mark, “Cheapside, 1614,”<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c022'><sup>[53]</sup></a> perhaps
wearing the white silk shoulder-cape
with its trimmings of embossed
velvet which has been preserved, proud
that she was privileged to be the mother
of this son, the first child born of white
parents in New England, proud that she
had been the wife of a Governor and
Commissioner of eminence, and also the
mother of Josiah Winslow, the first native-born
Governor of any North American
commonwealth. Hers was a record
of which any woman of any century
might well be proud!<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c022'><sup>[54]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c015'>In social position and worldly comforts
her life was pre-eminent among the
colonists. Although Edward Winslow
had renounced some of his English
wealth, possibly, when he went to Holland
and adopted the trade of printer,
<span class='pageno' title='64' id='Page_64'></span>he “came into his own” again and was
in high favor with English courts and
statesmen. His services as agent and
commissioner, both for the Plymouth
colony and later for Cromwell, must
have necessitated long absences from
home, while his wife remained at Careswell,
the estate at Green Harbor,
Marshfield, caring for her younger
children, Elizabeth and Josiah Winslow.
By family tradition, Mistress Susanna
was a woman of graceful, aristocratic
bearing and of strong character. Sometimes
called Anna, as in her marriage
record to William White at Leyden,
February 11, 1612,<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c022'><sup>[55]</sup></a> she was the sister
of Dr. Samuel Fuller. Two children by
her first marriage died in 1615 and 1616;
with her boy, Resolved, about five or six
years old, she came with her husband
on <i>The Mayflower</i> and, at the end of
the voyage, bore her son, Peregrine
White.</p>

<p class='c015'>The tact, courtesy and practical sagacity
<span class='pageno' title='65' id='Page_65'></span>of Edward Winslow fitted him
for the many demands that were made
upon his diplomacy. One of the most
amusing stories of his experiences as
agent for Plymouth colony has been related
by himself<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c022'><sup>[56]</sup></a> when, at the request
of the Indians, he visited Massasoit, who
was ill, and brought about the recovery
of this chief by common sense methods
of treatment and by a “savory broth”
made from Indian corn, sassafras and
strawberry leaves, “strained through his
handkerchief.” The skill with which
Winslow cooked the broth and the
“relish” of ducks reflected credit upon
the household methods of Mistress
Winslow.</p>

<p class='c015'>After 1646, Edward Winslow did not
return to Plymouth for any long sojourn,
for Cromwell and his advisers
had recognized the worth of such a man
as commissioner.<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c022'><sup>[57]</sup></a> In 1655 he was sent
as one of three commissioners against
<span class='pageno' title='66' id='Page_66'></span>the Spaniards in the West Indies to
attack St. Domingo. Because of lack
of supplies and harmony among the
troops, the attack was a failure. To
atone for this the fleet started towards
Jamaica, but on the way, near Hispaniola,
Winslow was taken ill of fever and
died, May 8, 1655; he was buried at sea
with a military salute from forty-two
guns. The salary paid to Winslow
during these years was £1000, which was
large for those times. On April 18,
1656, a “representation” from his widow,
Susanna, and son was presented to the
Lord Protector and council, asking that,
although Winslow’s death occurred the
previous May, the remaining £500 of his
year’s salary might be paid to satisfy
his creditors.</p>

<p class='c015'>To his wife and family Winslow,
doubtless, wrote letters as graceful and
interesting as are the few business
epistles that are preserved in the Winthrop
Papers.<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c022'><sup>[58]</sup></a> That he was anxious
<span class='pageno' title='67' id='Page_67'></span>to return to his family is evident from
a letter by President Steele of the Society
for Propagating the Gospel in
New England (in 1650), which Winslow
was also serving;<a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c022'><sup>[59]</sup></a> “Winslow was
unwilling to be longer kept from his
family, but his great acquaintance and
influence were of service to the cause so
great that it was hoped he would remain
for a time longer.” In his will, which
is now in Somerset House, London,
dated 1654, he left his estate at Marshfield
to his son, Josiah, with the stipulation
that his wife, Susanna, should be
allowed a full third part thereof through
her life.<a id='r60' /><a href='#f60' class='c022'><sup>[60]</sup></a> She lived twenty-five years
longer, dying in October, 1680, at the
estate, Careswell. It is supposed that
she was buried on the hillside cemetery
of the Daniel Webster estate in Marshfield,
where, amid tangles and flowers,
may be located the grave-stones of her
children and grandchildren.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sharing with Mistress Susanna White
<span class='pageno' title='68' id='Page_68'></span>Winslow the distinction of being mother
of a child born on <i>The Mayflower</i> was
Mistress Elizabeth Hopkins, whose son,
Oceanus, was named for his birthplace.
She was the second wife of Stephen
Hopkins, who was one of the leaders
with Winslow and Standish on early
expeditions. With her stepchildren, Constance
and Giles, and her little daughter,
Damaris, she bore the rigors of
those first years, bore other children,—Caleb,
Ruth, Deborah and Elizabeth,—and
cared for a large estate, including
servants and many cattle. The inventory
of the Hopkins estate revealed an
abundance of beds and bedding, yellow
and green rugs, curtains and spinning-wheels,
and much wearing apparel. The
home-life surely had incidents of excitement,
as is shown by the accusations
and fines against Stephen Hopkins
for “suffering excessive drinking at his
house, 1637, when William Reynolds
was drunk and lay under the table,”
and again for “suffering men to drink
<span class='pageno' title='69' id='Page_69'></span>in his house on the Lord’s Day, both
before and after the meeting—and
allowing his servant and others to drink
more than for ordinary refreshing and
to play shovell board and such like misdemeanors.”<a id='r61' /><a href='#f61' class='c022'><sup>[61]</sup></a>
Such lapses in conduct
at the Hopkins house were atoned for
by the services which Stephen Hopkins
rendered to the colony as explorer,
assistant to the governor and other
offices which suited his reliable and fearless
disposition.</p>

<p class='c015'>These occasional “misdemeanors” in
the Hopkins household were slight compared
with the records against “the black
sheep” of the colony, the family of Billingtons
from London. The mother,
Helen or Ellen, did not seem to redeem
the reputation of husband and
sons; traditionally she was called “the
scold.” After her husband had been
executed in 1630, for the first murder
in the colony, for he had waylaid
and killed John Newcomen, she married
<span class='pageno' title='70' id='Page_70'></span>Gregory Armstrong. She had various
controversies in court with her son
and others. In 1636, she was accused
of slander by “Deacon” John Doane,—she
had charged him with unfairness in
mowing her pasture lot,—and she was
sentenced to a fine of five pounds and
“to sit in the stocks and be publickly
whipt.”<a id='r62' /><a href='#f62' class='c022'><sup>[62]</sup></a> Her second husband died in
1650 and she lived several years longer,
occupying a “tenement” granted to her
in her son’s house at North Plymouth.
Apparently her son, John, after his fractious
youth, died; Francis married Christian
Penn, the widow of Francis Eaton.
Their children seem to have “been bound
out” for service while the parents were
convicted of trying to entice the children
away from their work and, consequently,
they were punished by sitting in the
stocks on “lecture days.”<a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c022'><sup>[63]</sup></a> In his later
life, Francis Billington became more
stable in character and served on committees.
His last offense was the mild
<span class='pageno' title='71' id='Page_71'></span>one “of drinking tobacco on the highway.”
Apparently, Helen Billington had
many troubles and little sympathy in the
Plymouth colony.</p>

<p class='c015'>As companions to these matrons of
the pioneer days were four maidens who
must have been valuable as assistants in
housework and care of the children,—Priscilla
Mullins, Mary Chilton, Elizabeth
Tilley and Constance Hopkins.
The first three had been orphaned during
that first winter; probably, they
became members of the households of
Elder Brewster and Governor Carver.
All have left names that are most
honorably cherished by their many
descendants. Priscilla Mullins has been
celebrated in romance and poetry.
Very little real knowledge exists about
her and many of the surmises would be
more interesting if they could be proved.
She was well-born, for her father, at his
death, was mentioned with regret<a id='r64' /><a href='#f64' class='c022'><sup>[64]</sup></a> as
“a man pious and well-deserving, endowed
<span class='pageno' title='72' id='Page_72'></span>also with considerable outward
estate; and had it been the will of God
that he had survived, might have proved
an useful instrument in his place.”
There was a family tradition of a castle,
Molyneux or Molines, in Normandy.
The title of <i>Mr.</i> indicated that he was a
man of standing and he was a counsellor
in state and church. Perhaps he died
on shipboard at Plymouth, because his
will, dated April 2, 1621, was witnessed
by John Carver, Christopher Jones and
Giles Heald, probably the captain and
surgeon of the ship, <i>Mayflower</i>.</p>

<p class='c015'>This will, which has been recently
found in Dorking, Surrey, England, has
had important influence upon research.
We learn that an older sister, Sarah
Blunden, living in Surrey, was named
as administratrix, and that a son, William
(who came to Plymouth before
1637) was to have money, bonds and
stocks in England. Goods in Virginia
and more money,—ten pounds each,—were
bequeathed equally to his wife
<span class='pageno' title='73' id='Page_73'></span>Alice, his daughter Priscilla and the
younger son, Joseph. Interesting also
is the item of “xxj dozen shoes and
thirteene paire of boots wch I give unto
the Companie’s hands for forty pounds
at seaven yeares.” If the Company
would not accept the rate, these shoes
and boots were to be for the equal
benefit of his wife and son, William.
To his friend, John Carver, he commits
his wife and children and also asks for
a “special eye to my man Robert wch
hath not so approved himself as I would
he should have done.”<a id='r65' /><a href='#f65' class='c022'><sup>[65]</sup></a> Before this will
was probated, July 23, 1621, John
Carver, Mistress Alice Mullins, the son,
Joseph, and the man, Robert Carter (or
Cartier) were all dead, leaving Priscilla
to carry on the work to which they had
pledged their lives. Perhaps the brother
and sister in England were children of
an earlier marriage,<a id='r66' /><a href='#f66' class='c022'><sup>[66]</sup></a> as Alice Mullins
has been spoken of as a second wife.</p>

<p class='c015'>Priscilla was about twenty years old
<span class='pageno' title='74' id='Page_74'></span>when she came to Plymouth. By tradition
she was handsome, witty, deft and
skilful as spinner and cook. Into her
life came John Alden, a cooper of unknown
family, who joined the Pilgrims
at Southampton, under promise to stay
a year. Probably he was not the first
suitor for Priscilla’s hand, for tradition
affirmed that she had been sought in
Leyden. The single sentence by Bradford
tells the story of their romance:
“being a hop[e]full yong man was much
desired, but left to his owne liking to go
or stay when he came here; but he
stayed, and maryed here.” With him he
brought a Bible, printed 1620,<a id='r67' /><a href='#f67' class='c022'><sup>[67]</sup></a> probably
a farewell gift or purchase as he left
England. When the grant of land and
cattle was made in 1627, he was twenty-eight
years old, and had in his family,
Priscilla, his wife, a daughter, Elizabeth,
aged three, and a son, John, aged one.<a id='r68' /><a href='#f68' class='c022'><sup>[68]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c015'>The poet, Longfellow, was a descendant
<span class='pageno' title='75' id='Page_75'></span>of Priscilla Alden, and he had often
heard the story of the courtship of Priscilla
by Miles Standish, through John
Alden as his proxy. It was said to date
back to a poem, “Courtship,” by Moses
Mullins, 1672. In detail it was given
by Timothy Alden in “American Epitaphs,”
1814,<a id='r69' /><a href='#f69' class='c022'><sup>[69]</sup></a> but there are here some
deflections from facts as later research
has revealed them. The magic words of
romance, “Why don’t you speak for
yourself, John?” are found in this early
narrative.</p>

<p class='c015'>There was more than romance in the
lives of John and Priscilla Alden as the
“vital facts” indicate. Their first home
was at Town Square, Plymouth, on the
site of the first school-house but, by
1633, they lived upon a farm of one
hundred and sixty-nine acres in Duxbury.
Their first house here was about
three hundred feet from the present
Alden house, which was built by the son,
Jonathan, and is now occupied by the
<span class='pageno' title='76' id='Page_76'></span>eighth John Alden. It must have been a
lonely farmstead for Priscilla, although
she made rare visits, doubtless on an ox
or a mare, or in an ox-cart with her children,
to see Barbara Standish at Captain’s
Hill, or to the home of Jonathan
Brewster, a few miles distant. As farmer,
John Alden was not so successful
as he would have been at his trade
of cooper. Moreover, he gave much of
his time to the service of the colony
throughout his manhood, acting as assistant
to the Governor, treasurer, surveyor,
agent and military recruit. Like
many another public servant of his day
and later, he “became low in his estate”
and was allowed a small gratuity of ten
pounds because “he hath been occationed
to spend time at the Courts on the
Countryes occasion and soe hath done
this many yeares.”<a id='r70' /><a href='#f70' class='c022'><sup>[70]</sup></a> He had also been
one of the eight “undertakers” who, in
1627, assumed the debts and financial
support of the Plymouth colony.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='77' id='Page_77'></span>Eleven children had been born to
John and Priscilla Alden, five sons and
six daughters. Sarah married Alexander
Standish and so cemented the two
families in blood as well as in friendship.
Ruth, who married John Bass, became
the ancestress of John Adams and John
Quincy Adams. Elizabeth, who married
William Pabodie, had thirteen children,
eleven of them girls, and lived to be
ninety-three years; at her death the
<i>Boston News Letter</i><a id='r71' /><a href='#f71' class='c022'><sup>[71]</sup></a> extolled her as
“exemplary, virtuous and pious and her
memory is blessed.” Possibly with all
her piety she had a good share of the
independence of spirit which was accredited
to her mother; in her husband’s
will<a id='r72' /><a href='#f72' class='c022'><sup>[72]</sup></a> she is given her “third at Little
Compton” and an abundance of household
stuff, but with this reservation,—“If
she will not be contented with her
thirds at Little Compton, but shall claim
her thirds in both Compton and Duxbury
or marry again, I do hereby make
<span class='pageno' title='78' id='Page_78'></span>voyde all my bequest unto her and she
shall share only the parte as if her husband
died intestate.” A portrait of her
shows dress of rich materials.</p>

<p class='c015'>Captain John Alden seems to have
been more adventuresome than the other
boys in Priscilla’s family. He was
master of a merchantman in Boston and
commander of armed vessels which supplied
marine posts with provisions. Like
his sister, Elizabeth, he had thirteen
children. He was once accused of witchcraft,
when he was present at a trial,
and was imprisoned fifteen weeks without
being allowed bail.<a id='r73' /><a href='#f73' class='c022'><sup>[73]</sup></a> He escaped
and hurried to Duxbury, where he must
have astonished his mother by the recital
of his adventures. He left an estate of
£2059, in his will, two houses, one of
wood worth four hundred pounds, and
another of brick worth <a id='err088'></a>two hundred and seventy pounds,
besides much plate, brass and money and
debts amounting to £1259, “the most of
which are desperite.” A tablet in the
<span class='pageno' title='79' id='Page_79'></span>wall of the Old South Church at Copley
Square, Boston, records his death at the
age of seventy-five, March, 1701. He
was an original member of this church.
Perhaps Priscilla varied her peaceful life
by visits to this affluent son in Boston.</p>

<p class='c015'>There is no evidence of the date of
Priscilla Alden’s death or the place of
her burial. She was living and present,
with her husband, at Josiah Winslow’s
funeral in 1680. She must have died
before her husband, for in his <a id='err089'></a>inventory,
1686, he makes no mention of her. He
left a small estate of only a little over
forty pounds, although he had given to
his sons land in Duxbury, Taunton,
Middleboro and Bridgewater.<a id='r74' /><a href='#f74' class='c022'><sup>[74]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c015'>Probably Priscilla also bestowed some
of her treasures upon her children before
she died. Some of her spoons, pewter
and candle-sticks have been traced by
inheritance. It is not likely that she was
“rich in this world’s goods” through her
marriage, but she had a husband whose
<span class='pageno' title='80' id='Page_80'></span>fidelity to state and religion have ever
been respected. To his memory Rev.
John Cotton wrote some elegiac verses;
Justin Winsor has emphasized the honor
which is still paid to the name of John
Alden in Duxbury and Plymouth:<a id='r75' /><a href='#f75' class='c022'><sup>[75]</sup></a>
“He was possessed of a sound judgment
and of talents which, though not brilliant,
were by no means ordinary—decided,
ardent, resolute, and persevering,
indifferent to danger, a bold and
hardy man, stern, austere and unyielding
and of incorruptible integrity.”</p>

<p class='c015'>The name of Mary Chilton is pleasant
to the ear and imagination. Chilton
Street and Chiltonville in Plymouth, and
the Chilton Club in Boston, keep alive
memories of this girl who was, by persistent
tradition, the first woman who
stepped upon the rock of landing at
Plymouth harbor. This tradition was
given in writing, in 1773, by Ann Taylor,
the grandchild of Mary Chilton
and John Winslow.<a id='r76' /><a href='#f76' class='c022'><sup>[76]</sup></a> Her father, James
<span class='pageno' title='81' id='Page_81'></span>Chilton, sometimes with the Dutch spelling,
Tgiltron, was a man of influence
among the early leaders, but he died at
Cape Cod, December 8, 1620. He came
from Canterbury, England, to Holland.
By the records on the Roll of Freemen
of the City of Canterbury,<a id='r77' /><a href='#f77' class='c022'><sup>[77]</sup></a> he is named
as James Chylton, tailor, “Freeman by
Gift, 1583.” Earlier Chiltons,—William,
spicer, and Nicholas, clerk,—are
classified as “Freemen by Redemption.”
Three children were baptized in St.
Paul’s Church, Canterbury,—Isabella,
1586; Jane, 1589; and Ingle, 1599.
Isabella was married in Leyden to
Roger Chandler five years before <i>The
Mayflower</i> sailed. Evidently, Mary bore
the same name as an older sister
whose burial is recorded at St. Martin’s,
Canterbury, in 1593. Isaac Chilton, a
glass-maker, may have been brother or
cousin of James. Of Mary’s mother
almost nothing has been found except
<span class='pageno' title='82' id='Page_82'></span>mention of her death during the infection
of 1621.<a id='r78' /><a href='#f78' class='c022'><sup>[78]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c015'>When <i>The Fortune</i> arrived in November,
1621, it brought Mary Chilton’s
future husband among the passengers,—John
Winslow, younger brother of Edward.
Not later than 1627 they were
married and lived at first in the central
settlement, and later in Plain Dealing,
North Plymouth. They had ten children.
The son, John, was Brigadier-General
in the <a id='err092'></a>Army.
John Winslow, Sr., seemed to show a
spirit of enterprise by the exchange and
sale of his “lots” in Plymouth and afterwards
in Boston where he moved his
family, and became a successful owner
and master of merchant ships. Here he
acquired land on Devonshire Street and
Spring Lane and also on Marshall
Lane and Hanover Street. From
Plans and Deeds, prepared by Annie
Haven Thwing,<a id='r79' /><a href='#f79' class='c022'><sup>[79]</sup></a> one may locate a home
<span class='pageno' title='83' id='Page_83'></span>of Mary Chilton Winslow in Boston, a
lot 72 and 85, 55 and 88, in the rear of
the first Old South Church, at the south-west
corner of Joyliffe’s Lane, now
Devonshire Street, and Spring Lane.
It was adjacent to land owned by John
Winthrop and Richard Parker. By
John Winslow’s will, probated May 21,
1674, he bequeathed this house, land,
gardens and a goodly sum of money and
shares of stock to his wife and children.
The house and stable, with land, was inventoried
for £490 and the entire estate
for £2946-14-10. He had a Katch
<i>Speedwell</i>, with cargoes of pork, sugar
and tobacco, and a Barke <i>Mary</i>, whose
produce was worth £209; these were to
be divided among his children. His
money was also to be divided, including
133 “peeces of eight.”<a id='r80' /><a href='#f80' class='c022'><sup>[80]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c015'>Interesting as are the items of this
will, which afford proofs that Mary
Chilton as matron had luxuries undreamed
of in the days of 1621, <i>her</i> will
<span class='pageno' title='84' id='Page_84'></span>is even more important for us. It is
one of the three <i>original</i> known wills of
<i>Mayflower</i> passengers, the others being
those of <a id='err094'></a>Edward Winslow and Peregrine White.
Mary Chilton’s will is in the
Suffolk Registry of Probate,<a id='r81' /><a href='#f81' class='c022'><sup>[81]</sup></a> Boston,
in good condition, on paper 18 by 14
inches. The will was made July 31,
1676. Among other interesting bequests
are: to my daughter Sarah (Middlecot)
“my Best gowne and Pettecoat and my
silver beare bowl” and to each of her
children “a silver cup with a handle.”
To her grandchild, William Payne, was
left her “great silver Tankard” and to
her granddaughter, Ann Gray, “a trunk
of Linning” (linen) with bed, bolsters
and ten pounds in money. Many silver
spoons and “ruggs” were to be divided.
To her grandchild, Susanna Latham,
was definite allotment of “my <a id='err094-2'></a>Petty
coate with silke Lace.” In the
inventory one may find commentary
upon the valuation of these goods—“silk
<span class='pageno' title='85' id='Page_85'></span>gowns and pettecoats” for £6-10,
twenty-two napkins at seven shillings,
and three “great pewter dishes” and
twenty small pieces of pewter for two
pounds, six shillings. She had gowns,
mantles, head bands, fourteen in number,
seventeen linen caps, six white aprons,
pocket-handkerchiefs and all other articles
of dress. Mary Chilton Winslow
could not write her name, but
she made a very neat mark, <i>M.</i> She
was buried beneath the Winslow coat of
arms at the front of King’s Chapel
Burial-ground in Boston. She closely
rivalled, if she did not surpass in wealth
and social position, her sister-in-law,
Susanna White Winslow.</p>

<p class='c015'>Elizabeth Tilley had a more quiet life,
but she excelled her associates among
these girls of Plymouth in one way,—she
could write her name very well.
Possibly she was taught by her husband,
John Howland who left, in his inventory,
an ink-horn, and who wrote
records and letters often for the colonists.
<span class='pageno' title='86' id='Page_86'></span>For many years, until the discovery
and printing of Bradford’s
History of Plymouth Plantation in
1856, it was assumed that Elizabeth
Tilley was either the daughter or granddaughter
of Governor Carver; such
misstatement even appears upon the
Howland tombstone in the old burying-ground
at Plymouth. Efforts to explain
by assuming a second marriage of
Carver or a first marriage of Howland
fail to convince, for, surely, such relationships
would have been mentioned
by Bradford, Winslow, Morton or
Prence. After the death of her parents,
during the first winter, Elizabeth remained
with the Carver household until
that was broken by death; afterwards
she was included in the family over
which John Howland was considered
“head”; according to the grant of 1624
he was given an acre each for himself,
Elizabeth Tilley, Desire Minter, and
the boy, William Latham.</p>

<p class='c015'>The <a id='err096'></a>step-mother of Elizabeth Tilley bore
<span class='pageno' title='87' id='Page_87'></span>a Dutch name, Bridget Van De Veldt.<a id='r82' /><a href='#f82' class='c022'><sup>[82]</sup></a>
Elizabeth was ten or twelve years
younger than her husband, at least, for
he was twenty-eight years old in 1620.
They were married, probably, by 1623-4,
for the second child, John, was born in
1626. It is not known how long Howland
had been with the Pilgrims at
Leyden; he may have come there with
Cushman in 1620 or, possibly, he joined
the company at Southampton. His ancestry
is still in some doubt in spite of
the efforts to trace it to one John Howland,
“gentleman and citizen and salter”
of London.<a id='r83' /><a href='#f83' class='c022'><sup>[83]</sup></a> Probably the outfit necessary
for the voyage was furnished to
him by Carver, and the debt was to be
paid in some service, clerical or other;
in no other sense was he a “servant.”
He signed the compact of <i>The Mayflower</i>
and was one of the “ten principal
men” chosen to select a site for the
colony. For many years he was prominent
<span class='pageno' title='88' id='Page_88'></span>in civic affairs of the state and
church. He was among the liberals
towards Quakers as were his brothers
who came later to Marshfield,—Arthur
and Henry. At Rocky Neck, near the
Jones River in Kingston, as it is now
called, the Howland household was prosperous,
with nine children to keep Elizabeth
Tilley’s hands occupied. She
lived until past <a id='err098'></a>eighty years, and died
at the home of her daughter, Lydia
Howland Brown, in Swanzey, in 1687.
Among the articles mentioned in her
will are many books of religious type.
Her husband’s estate as inventoried was
not large, but mentioned such useful
articles as silk neckcloths, four dozen
buttons and many skeins of silk.<a id='r84' /><a href='#f84' class='c022'><sup>[84]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c015'>Constance or Constanta Hopkins was
probably about the same age as Elizabeth
Tilley, for she was married before
1627 to Nicholas Snow, who came in
<i>The Ann</i>. They had twelve children, and
among the names one recognizes such
<span class='pageno' title='89' id='Page_89'></span>familiar patronymics of the two families
as Mark, Stephen, Ruth and Elizabeth.
Family tradition has ascribed
beauty and patience to this maiden
who, doubtless, served well both in her
father’s large family and in the community.
Her step-sister, Damaris, married
Jacob Cooke, son of the Pilgrim,
Francis Cooke.</p>

    <div><span class='c020'>COMPANIONS WHO ARRIVED IN THE FORTUNE AND THE ANN</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>After the arrival of <i>The Ann</i>, in the
summer of 1623, the women who came
in <i>The Mayflower</i> had more companions
of good breeding and efficiency. Elizabeth
Warren, wife of Richard, came
with her five daughters; it is safe to
assume the latter were attractive for, in
a few years, all were well married. Two
sons were born after Elizabeth arrived
at Plymouth, Nathaniel and Joseph.
For forty-five years she survived her
husband, who had been a man of
strength of character and usefulness as
well as some wealth. When she died
at the age of ninety-three leaving
seventy-five great grandchildren, the
old Plymouth Colony Records paid her
tribute,—“Mistress Elizabeth Warren,
<span class='pageno' title='94' id='Page_94'></span>haveing lived a Godly life came to her
Grave as a Shock of corn full Ripe.
She was honourably buried on the 24th
of October (1673).”</p>

<p class='c015'>Evidently, Mistress Warren was a
woman of independent means and efficiency,—else
she would have remarried,
as was the custom of the times. She
became one of the “purchasers” of the
colony and conveyed land, at different
times, near Eel River and what is now
Warren’s Cove, in Plymouth, to her
sons-in-law. An interesting sidelight
upon her character and home is found
in the Court Records;<a id='r85' /><a href='#f85' class='c022'><sup>[85]</sup></a> her servant,
Thomas Williams, was prosecuted for
“speaking profane and blasphemous
speeches against ye majestie of God.
There being some dissension between
him and his dame she, after other things,
exhorted him to fear God and doe his
duty.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Bridget Fuller followed her husband,
Dr. Samuel, and came in <i>The Ann</i>. She
<span class='pageno' title='95' id='Page_95'></span>also long survived her husband and did
not remarry. She carried on his household
and probably also his teaching for
many years after he fell victim to the
epidemic of infectious fever in 1633.
She was his third wife, but only two
children are known to have used the
Fuller cradle, now preserved in Pilgrim
Hall, Plymouth. It has been stated
that, in addition to these two, Samuel
and Mercy, another young child came
with its mother in <i>The Ann</i>, but did not
live long.<a id='r86' /><a href='#f86' class='c022'><sup>[86]</sup></a> The son, Samuel, born about
1625, was minister for many years
at Middleboro; he married Elizabeth
Brewster, thus preserving two friendly
families in kinship.</p>

<p class='c015'>Evidently, Bridget Fuller was very
ill and not expected to recover when her
husband was dying, for in his will, made
at that time, he arranged for the education
of his children by his brother-in-law,
William Wright, unless it “shall please
God to recover my wife out of her weake
<span class='pageno' title='96' id='Page_96'></span>estate of sickness.” It is interesting also
that, in this will, provision was made for
the education of his daughter, Mercy,
as well as his son, Samuel, by Mrs.
Heeks or Hicks, the wife of Robert
Hicks who came in <i>The Ann</i>.<a id='r87' /><a href='#f87' class='c022'><sup>[87]</sup></a> Not
alone for his own children did this good
physician provide education, but also for
others “put to him for schooling,”—with
special mention of Sarah Converse “left
to me by her sick father.” This kind,
generous doctor left a considerable estate,
in spite of the many “debts for
physicke,” including that of “Mr. Roger
Williams which was freely given.” One
specific gift was for the good of the
church and this forms the nucleus of a
fund which is still known as the Fuller
Ministerial Fund of the Plymouth Congregational
Church. Its source was “the
first cow calfe that his Brown Cow
should have.”<a id='r88' /><a href='#f88' class='c022'><sup>[88]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='97' id='Page_97'></span>Mrs. Alice Morse Earle says that
gloves were gifts of sentiment;<a id='r89' /><a href='#f89' class='c022'><sup>[89]</sup></a> they
were generously bestowed by this physician
of old Plymouth. Money to buy
gloves, or gloves, were bequeathed to
Mistress Alice Bradford and Governor
Winthrop of the Massachusetts Bay
Colony; also to John Winslow, John
Jenny and Rebecca Prence. The price
allowed for a pair of gloves was from
two to five shillings. Probably these
may have been the fringed leather
gloves or the knit gloves described
by Mrs. Earle. Another bequest
was his “best hat and band never
worn to old Mr. William Brewster.”
To his wife was left not alone two
houses, “one at Smeltriver and another
in town,” but also a fine supply of furnishings
and clothes, including stuffe
gown, red pettecoate, stomachers,
aprons, shoes and kerchiefs. Mistress
Fuller lived until after 1667, and exerted
<span class='pageno' title='98' id='Page_98'></span>a strong influence upon the educational
life of Plymouth.</p>

<p class='c015'>Is it heresy to question whether the
sampler,<a id='r90' /><a href='#f90' class='c022'><sup>[90]</sup></a> accredited to Lora or Lorea
Standish, the daughter of Captain Miles
and Barbara Standish, was not more
probably the work of the granddaughter,
Lorea, the child of Alexander Standish
and Sarah Alden? The style and motto
are more in accord with the work of the
later generation and, surely, the necessary
time and materials for such work
would be more probable after the pioneer
days. This later Lora married <a id='err108'></a>Abraham
Sampson, son of the Henry who came
as a boy in <i>The Mayflower</i>.<a id='r91' /><a href='#f91' class='c022'><sup>[91]</sup></a> The embroidered
cap<a id='r92' /><a href='#f92' class='c022'><sup>[92]</sup></a> and bib, supposed to
have been made by Mistress Barbara for
her daughter, would prove that she had</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c024'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“hands with such convenient skill</div>
      <div class='line'>As to conduce to vertu void of shame”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>which were the aspiration of the girl
who embroidered, or “wrought,” the
<span class='pageno' title='99' id='Page_99'></span>sampler. It is a pleasant commentary
upon the tastes and industry of Mistress
Barbara Standish that, amid the
cares of a large family and farm, she
found time for such dainty embroideries
as we find in the cap and bib.</p>

<p class='c015'>Probably two young sons of Captain
and Barbara Standish, Charles and
John, died in the infectious fever epidemic
of 1633. A second Charles with
his brothers, Alexander, Miles and
Josiah, and his sister, Lorea, gladdened
the hearth of the Standish home on Captain’s
Hill, Duxbury. A goodly estate
was left at the death of Captain Miles,
including a well-equipped house, cattle,
mault mill, swords (as one would expect),
sixteen pewter pieces and several
books of classic literature,—Homer,
Cæsar’s Commentaries, histories of
Queen Elizabeth’s reign, military histories,
and three Bibles with commentaries
upon religious matters. There were
also medical books, for Standish was reputed
to have been a student and
<span class='pageno' title='100' id='Page_100'></span>practitioner in times of emergency in
Duxbury. He suffered a painful illness
at the close of his vigorous, adventuresome
life. Perhaps Barbara needed, at
times, grace to endure that “warm
temper” which Pastor Robinson deplored
in Miles Standish, a comment
which the intrepid Captain forgave and
answered by a bequest to the granddaughter
of this loved pastor. We may
be sure Barbara was proud of the
mighty share which her husband had in
saving Plymouth Colony from severe
disaster, if not from extinction. It is
surmised that Barbara Standish was
buried in Connecticut where she lived
during the last of her life with her son,
Josiah. Possibly, however, she may
have been buried beside her husband,
sons, daughter and daughter-in-law,
Mary Dingley, in Duxbury.<a id='r93' /><a href='#f93' class='c022'><sup>[93]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c015'>The Colonial Governor and his Lady
ever held priority of rank. Such came
<span class='pageno' title='101' id='Page_101'></span>to Mrs. Alice Southworth when she
married Governor William Bradford a
few days after her arrival on <i>The Ann</i>.
Tradition has said persistently that this
was the consummation of an earlier
romance which was broken off by the
marriage of Alice Carpenter to Edward
Southworth in Leyden. The death of
her first husband left her with two sons,
Thomas and Constant Southworth, who
came to Plymouth before 1628. She
had sisters in the Colony: Priscilla,
the wife of William Wright, came in
<i>The Fortune</i>; Dr. Fuller’s first wife had
been another sister; Juliana, wife of
George Morton, was a third who came
also in <i>The Ann</i>. Still another sister,
Mary Carpenter, came later and lived
in the Governor’s family for many years.
At her death in her ninety-first year,
she was mourned as “a Godly old maid,
never married.”<a id='r94' /><a href='#f94' class='c022'><sup>[94]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c015'>The first home of the Bradfords in
Plymouth was at Town Square where
<span class='pageno' title='102' id='Page_102'></span>now stands the Bradford block. About
1627-8 they moved, for a part of the
year, to the banks of the Jones River,
now Kingston, a place which had
strongly appealed to Bradford as a good
site for the original settlement when the
men were making their explorations in
December, 1620. William, Joseph and
<a id='err112'></a>Mercy were born to inherit from their
parents the fine characters of both Governor
and Alice Bradford, and also to
pass on to their children the carved
chests, wrought and carved chairs, case
and knives, desk, silver spoons, fifty-one
pewter dishes, five dozen napkins, three
striped carpets, four Venice glasses, besides
cattle and cooking utensils and
many books. That the Governor had a
proper “dress suit” was proved by the
inventory of “stuffe suit with silver buttons
and cloaks of violet, light colour
and faced with taffety and linen throw.”</p>

<p class='c015'>As Mistress Bradford could only
“make her mark,” she probably did not
appreciate the remarkable collection, for
<span class='pageno' title='103' id='Page_103'></span>the times, of Latin, Greek, Hebrew,
Dutch and French books as well as the
studies in philosophy and theology which
were in her husband’s library. There is
no doubt that the first and second generations
of girls and boys in Plymouth
Colony had elementary instruction, at
least, under Dr. Fuller and Mrs. Hicks
as well as by other teachers. Bradford,
probably, would also attend to the education
of his own family. The Governor’s
wife has been accredited with
“labouring diligently for the improvement
of the young women of Plymouth
and to have been eminently worthy of
her high position.”<a id='r95' /><a href='#f95' class='c022'><sup>[95]</sup></a> She was the sole
executrix of her husband’s estate of
£1005,—a proof of her ability.</p>

<p class='c015'>Sometimes her cheerfulness must have
been taxed to comfort her husband, as
old age came upon him and he fell into
the gloomy mood reflected in such lines
as these:<a id='r96' /><a href='#f96' class='c022'><sup>[96]</sup></a></p>

<div class='lg-container-b c024'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' title='104' id='Page_104'></span>“In fears and wants, through weal and woe,</div>
      <div class='line'>A pilgrim passed I to and fro;</div>
      <div class='line'>Oft left of them whom I did trust,</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>When Mistress Alice Bradford died
she was “mourned, though aged” by
many. To her memory, Nathaniel Morton,
her nephew, wrote some lines which
were more biographic than poetical, recalling
her early life as an exile with her
father from England for the truth’s sake,
her first marriage</p>

<p class='c015'>This is not a very lively, graphic description
of the woman most honored,
perhaps, of all the pioneer women of
Plymouth, but we may add, by imagination,
a few sure traits of human kindliness
and grace. She was typical of
those women who came in <i>The Mayflower</i>
and her sister ships. Although
she escaped the tragic struggles and
illness of that first winter, yet she revealed
the same qualities of courage,
good sense, fidelity and vision which
were the watchwords of that group of
women in Plymouth colony. Yes,—they
had vision to see their part in the
sincere purpose to establish a new
standard of liberty in state and church,
to serve God and mankind with all their
integrity and resources.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' title='106' id='Page_106'></span>As the leaders among the men were
self-sacrificing and honorable in their
dealings with their financiers, with the
Indians and with each other, so the
women were faithful and true in their
homes and communal life. They took
scarcely any part in the civic administration,
for such responsibility did not
come into the lives of seventeenth century
women. They were actively interested
in the educational and religious life
of the colony. Their moral standards
were high and inflexible; they extolled,
and practised, the virtues of thrift and
industry. It may be well for women in
America today, who were querulous at
the restrictions upon sugar and electric
lights, to consider the good sense, and
good cheer, with which these women of
Plymouth Colony directed their thrifty
households.</p>

<p class='c015'>We would not assume that they were
free from the whims and foibles of
womankind,—and sometimes of mankind,—of
all ages. They were, doubtless,
<span class='pageno' title='107' id='Page_107'></span>contradictory and impulsive at
times; they could scold and they could
gossip. We believe that they laughed
sometimes, in the midst of dire want and
anxiety, and we know that they prayed
with sincerity and trust. They bore
children gladly and they trained them
“in the fear and admonition of the
Lord.” They were the progenitors of
thousands of fine men and women in all
parts of America today who honor the
<i>women</i> as well as the <i>men</i> of the old
Plymouth Colony,—the women who
faithfully performed, without any serious
discontent,</p>

law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
